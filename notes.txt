In Python and Sage we can assign an identifier (similar to a name tag) to an object.

Rules for naming identifiers in Python:

Identifiers can include letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_).
Identifiers cannot start with a digit.
Identifiers are case-sensitive
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

Python Keywords include:
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield

Soft keywords are only reserved under specific contexts. Soft keywords include match, case, type and _
