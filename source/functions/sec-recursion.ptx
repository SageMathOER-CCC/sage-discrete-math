    <title>Recursion</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. This approach is extensively used in mathematics and computer science, especially in the computation of binomial coefficients, the evaluation of polynomials, and the generation of sequences.

        <title>Recursion in Sequences</title>
        <p>
            A recursive sequence is defined by one or more base cases and a recursive step that relates each term to its predecessors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, <c>s</c> is a function representing the sequence. The equation <c>eqn</c> defines the recursive relation <m>s(n) = s(n-1) + 2\cdot s(n-2)</m>. The <c>rsolve()</c> function is then used to find a closed-form solution to this recurrence, given the initial conditions <m>s(0) = 2</m> and <m>s(1) = 7</m>. At last, we use <c>SR()</c> function to convert from Python notation to mathematical notation.

                from sympy import Function, rsolve
                from sympy.abc import n
                s = Function('s')
                eqn = s(n) - s(n-1) - 2*s(n-2)
                sol = rsolve(eqn, s(n), {s(0): 2, s(1): 7})
                show(SR(sol))

            <c>show()</c> function can be used to make the output visually more pleasing, you can try to remove it and see how the output looks instead.

        <title>Recursion with Binomial Coefficients</title>
        <p>
            Binomial coefficients, denoted as <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>, count the number of ways to choose <m>k</m> elements from an <m>n</m>-element set. They can be defined recursively. Sage can compute binomial coefficients using the <c>binomial(n, k)</c> function.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                binomial(5, 3)
            </input>
            <output></output>
        </sage>
        <p>
            We can also explore the recursive nature of binomials using a Python syntax.
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                def binomial_recursive(n, k):
                    if k == 0 or k == n:
                        return 1
                    else:
                        return binomial_recursive(n-1, k-1) + binomial_recursive(n-1, k)

                binomial_recursive(5, 3)
            </input>
            <output></output>
        </sage>
        <p>
            This function implements the recursive formula <m>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</m>, with base cases <m>\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1</m>.
