    <title>Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            A function from a set <m>A</m> into a set <m>B</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> into <m>B</m> such that each element of <m>A</m> is related to exactly one element of the set <m>B</m>. The set <m>A</m> is called the domain of the function, and the set <m>B</m> is called the co-domain. Functions are fundamental in both mathematics and computer science for describing mathematical relationships and implementing computational logic.

                Defining functions in Sage is not only useful for mathematical calculations but also for creating complex algorithms, modeling data, and simulating real-world scenarios in various fields of science and engineering.

            In Sage, functions can be defined using direct definition.

            For example, defining a function to calculate the cube of a number:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                f(x) = x^3
                show(f)
            </input>
            <output></output>
        </sage>

        <p>
            Sage provides powerful tools for visualizing functions, enabling you to explore the graphical representations of mathematical relationships. Graphs can be plotted directly from function definitions, offering insights into function behavior, such as continuity, limits, and extrema.

                Utilizing graphical representations of functions can greatly aid in understanding complex concepts in calculus and analysis, such as differentiation and integration, by providing a visual context.

            For example, to plot the function <m>f(x) = x^3</m> over the interval <m>[-2, 2]</m>:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                f(x) = x^3
                plot(f(x), x, -2, 2)
            </input>
