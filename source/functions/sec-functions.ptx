        <p> A function from a set <m>A</m> into a set <m>B</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> into <m>B</m>
            such that each element of <m>A</m> is related to exactly one element of the set <m>B</m>.
            The set <m>A</m> is called the domain of the function, and the set <m>B</m> is called
            the co-domain. Functions are fundamental in both mathematics and computer science for
            describing mathematical relationships and implementing computational logic. </p>

                Defining functions in Sage is not only useful for mathematical calculations but also
                for creating complex algorithms, modeling data, and simulating real-world scenarios
                in various fields of science and engineering.

            In Sage, functions can be defined using direct definition.
        </p>
        <p> For example, defining a function <m>f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</m> to
            calculate the cube of a number, such as 3: </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                f(x) = x^3
                show(f)
                f(3)

        <title>Graphical Representations</title>
        <p>
            Sage provides powerful tools for visualizing functions, enabling you to explore the
            graphical representations of mathematical relationships.

                Utilizing graphical representations of functions can greatly aid in understanding
                complex concepts in calculus and analysis, such as differentiation and integration,
                by providing a visual context.
            </p>

        <p> For example, to plot the function <m>f(x) = x^3</m> over the interval <m>[-2, 2]</m>: </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                f(x) = x^3
                plot(f(x), x, -2, 2)
            </input>
