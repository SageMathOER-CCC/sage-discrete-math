             <title>Set Membership Check</title>
            <p>
               SageMath allows you to easily check whether a certain element belongs to a set. You can use the <c>in</c> operator to check membership, which returns <c>True</c> if the element is in the set and <c>False</c> otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's consider A <m>= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</m>. We can check if the number <m>3</m> is in set A.

                    For organizations such as clubs, gyms, or online subscription services, set membership checks can be used to validate if a user is a member or subscriber. This can help control access to facilities or content.

                First, we construct the set S of all subsets of A, and then we ask if the set B as an element that belongs to A.
                Similarly, we can check if B <m>= {3, 4, 5, 6}</m> is a subset of A:
            </p>
            <sage>
                <input>
                S = Subsets(A)
                B = Set([3, 4, 5, 6])
                B in A
                </input>

        <!-- Set Union Subsection -->
        <subsection>
            <title>Union of Sets</title>
            <p>
                There are two distinct methods available in Sage for calculating unions. An advantage inherent in utilizing the union() method lies in its capability to accept an arbitrary number of sets as parameters. This means you can find the intersection of more than two sets in a single call.
            </p>

               <p>
                    Suppose A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. We can use the <c>union()</c> function here.
               </p>

                        This operation can be visualized in real-world scenarios such as merging two distinct music playlists into one. In this case, any song that appears in both playlists will only be listed once in the merged playlist.

                    B = Set([3, 4, 5, 6]) 
                    A.union(B)

                <output></output>
                </sage>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, we can also use the <c> | </c> operator to perform the union operation.  
                </p>

            <title>Set Intersection</title>
            <p>
                Similar to union, there are two methods of using the intersection function in sage.
            </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. We can use the <c>intersection()</c> function here.

                        A practical application of set intersection could be finding common members between two different social media groups. Members who belong to both groups represent the intersection of these groups.

                We have two methods to solve for difference as well.

                    Suppose A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {3, 4, 5, 6}. We can use the <c>difference()</c> function here.

                        In a real-life context, this can be seen as identifying items on a restaurant menu (set A) that you have not yet tried (set B), with A - B representing the new dishes to explore.

                For doing operations using involving multiple sets, we can repeat the operations to get our results, let us see an example.
