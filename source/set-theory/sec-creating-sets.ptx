	<title>Creating Sets</title>

	<subsection xml:id="subsec-Ways-to-create-a-set">
		<title>Sage Math Set</title>
		<p>
			We can create a set by inserting a list within a <c>Set()</c> function, with an uppercase <c>S</c>. We create a list with square brackets <c>[]</c>. Notice when we print the set, the elements are ordered and the duplicates are ignored.
		</p>

		<sage>
			<input>
				A = Set([5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1])
				print(A)
			</input>
		</sage>

		<sage>
			<input>
				A = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
				B = Set([5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1])
				A == B
			</input>
		</sage>

		<p>
			Since sets remove duplicates, the two sets are equal. A single equal sign <c>=</c> and double equal sign <c>==</c> have different meanings.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <term>equality operator</term> <c>==</c> is used to ask Sage if two values are the same. Sage compares the values on each side of the operator and returns the boolean value, <c>True</c> if they are equal, and <c>False</c> if they are not.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <term>assignment operator</term> <c>=</c> is used to assign a value to a variable. The value on the right side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left side.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are familiar with Python, you may have used a Python <c>set</c> with a lower case <c>s</c>. Even though Sage supports Python sets, we will be using Sage <c>Set</c> for the added features. Be sure to define <c>Sets()</c> with an upper case <c>S</c>.

		<title>Set Builder Notation</title>
		<p>
			Instead of explicitly listing the elements of a set, we can use a set builder notation to define a set. The set builder notation is a way to define a set by describing the properties of its elements.
		</p>

		<sage>
			<input>
				# Create a set of even numbers between 1 and 10
				C = Set([x for x in srange(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0])
				C
			</input>
		</sage>

		<p>
			Here we are introducing a new programming concept iteration. Iteration is a way to repeat a block of code multiple times and can be used to automate repetitive tasks. We could have created the same set by typing <c> evens = Set([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])</c>. Imagine if we wanted to create a set of even numbers between 1 and 100. It would be much easier to use iteration.
		</p>

		<sage>
			<input>
				D = Set([x for x in srange(1, 101) if x % 2 == 0])
				D
			</input>

		<title>Subsets</title>
		<p>
			Assume we have A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, to list all the subsets included in this set, we can use the <c>Subsets()</c> function to generate all the subsets and then use the <c>Set()</c> function to show us all the subsets.
		</p>
		<sage>
		  <input>
			A = Subsets([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
			Set(A)
