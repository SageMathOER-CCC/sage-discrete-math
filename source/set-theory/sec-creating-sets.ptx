		<p>
			We can create a set by wrapping a list <c>[element_0, element_1, element_2, element_n]</c> with <c>Set()</c>.
		</p>

		<sage>
			<input>
				mySageSet = Set([4, 2, 3, 3, 1])
				print(type(mySageSet))
				print(mySageSet)
			</input>
		</sage>

		<p>
			It looks like Sage has its own class for sets. Also notice when we print the set, the elements are ordered and the duplicates are ignored.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are familiar with Python, you may have used a Python <c>set</c> with a lower case <c>s</c>. Even though Sage supports Python sets, we will be using Sage <c>Sets</c> for the added features. Be sure to define <c>Sets()</c> with an upper case <c>S</c>
		</p>

		<p>
			If we need to work with a set that allows duplicate elements, we can use a Python list. We can also use lists to perform operations like iteration, indexing, slicing, etc.

		<p>
			Assume we have a Set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, to list all the subsets included in this set, we can use the <c>Subsets()</c> and <c>list()</c> functions.
		</p>
		<sage>
		  <input>
			A = Subsets([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
			list(A)
