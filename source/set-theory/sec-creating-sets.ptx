		<title>Sage Math Set</title>
		<p>
			We can create a set by inserting a list within a <c>Set()</c> function. We create a list with square brackets <c>[]</c>
		</p>

		<sage>
			<input>
				mySageSet = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
				print(type(mySageSet))
				print(mySageSet)
			</input>
		</sage>

		<p>
			It looks like Sage has its own class for sets.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also notice when we print the set, the elements are ordered and the duplicates are ignored.
		</p>

		<sage>
			<input>
				mySageSet = Set([5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1])
				print(mySageSet)
			</input>
		</sage>

		<sage>
			<input>
				myFirstSageSet = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
				mySecondSageSet = Set([5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1])
				myFirstSageSet == mySecondSageSet
			</input>
		</sage>

		<p>
			Since Sage Sets remove duplicates, the two sets are equal. A single equal sign <c>=</c> and double equal sign <c>==</c> have different meanings.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <term>equality operator</term> <c>==</c> is used to ask Sage if two values are the same. Sage compares the values on each side of the operator and returns the boolean value, <c>True</c> if they are equal, and <c>False</c> if they are not.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <term>assignment operator</term> <c>=</c> is used to assign a value to a variable. The value on the right side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left side.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are familiar with Python, you may have used a Python <c>set</c> with a lower case <c>s</c>. Even though Sage supports Python sets, we will be using Sage <c>Sets</c> for the added features. Be sure to define <c>Sets()</c> with an upper case <c>S</c>

		<p>
			Assume we have a Set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, to list all the subsets included in this set, we can use the <c>Subsets()</c> and <c>list()</c> functions.
		</p>
		<sage>
		  <input>
			A = Subsets([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
			list(A)
