    <title>Partial Order</title>
    <p>
        A relation on a set is a Partial Order (PO) <m>\prec</m> if it satisfies the reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive properties. A poset is a set with a partial order relation. For example, the following set of numbers with a relation given by divisibility is a poset.

        <input>
            A = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8])

            r = [(a, b) for a in A for b in A if a.divides(b)]

            DiGraph(r, loops=True)

        Revised: A Hasse diagram is a simplified visual representation of a poset. Unlike a digraph, the relative position of vertices has meaning: if x relates to y,  then the vertex x appears lower in the drawing than the vertex y. Self-loops are assumed and not shown. Transitive property is assumed and not shown.

        Remove: A Hasse diagram is a visual representation of a poset. Unlike a digraph, the position of the height of the vertex has meaning. The vertex from bellow relates to the vertex above. A Hasse diagram is a more compact compared to a directed graph due to the following assumptions:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a Hasse diagram the self-loops are assumed and not visualized.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A poset satisfies the antisymmetric property so the arrows are omitted.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Due to the transitive property, the vertex from bellow relates to the vertex above and the intermediate connections are implied and not visualized.
