    <title>Partial Order</title>
    <p>
        A Partial Order (PO) <m>\prec</m> satisfies the following properties:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <term>Reflexive</term> a R a for all a <m>\in</m> A
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <term>Antisymmetric</term> If a R b and b R a then a = b for all a, b <m>\in</m> A
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <term>Transitive</term> If a R b and b R c then a R c for all a, b, c <m>\in</m> A
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <em>Example:</em> Let <m>B = \{0,1\}</m> and define <m>A</m> as the power set of <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A = \mathcal{P}(B)</m>. Establish a relation <m>R</m> on <m>A</m> where <m>XRY</m> if and only if <m>X \subseteq Y</m>. This relation represents the idea of one set being a subset of another within the power set of <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To explore how elements relate within these examples, consider the element <m>\{1\}</m> in the context of the second example. The set <m>\{1\}</m> is not related to the empty set, denoted as <m>\{\}</m>, because <m>\{1\}</m> is not a subset of <m>\{\}</m>. Similarly, <m>\{1\}</m> does not relate to <m>\{0\}</m> because <m>\{1\}</m> is not a subset of <m>\{0\}</m>. However, <m>\{1\}</m> is related to <m>\{0,1\}</m> because <m>\{1\}</m> is indeed a subset of <m>\{0,1\}</m>, which we denote as <m>\{1\} R \{0,1\}</m>.
