    <title>Partial Order</title>
    <p>
        A Partial Order (PO) <m>\prec</m> satisfies the following properties:
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Reflexive</term>: a relates to a for all elements a in the set A. All the elements relate to themselves.
        <me>
            aRa \quad \forall a \in A
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Antisymmetric</term>: The only case that a relates to be and b relates to a is when a and b are equal.
        <me>
            \text{If } aRb \text{ and } bRa \text{ then } a = b \quad \forall a, b \in A
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Transitive</term>: if a relates to b and b relates to c, then a relates to c.
        <me>
            \text{If } aRb \text{ and } bRc \text{ then } aRc \quad \forall a, b, c \in A
        </me>
    </p>

            # Example Partial Order
            A = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8])
            P = Poset((A, lambda x, y: x.divides(y)))
            P.plot()

        <em>Example:</em> Let <m>B = \{0,1\}</m> and define <m>A</m> as the power set of <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A = \mathcal{P}(B)</m>. Establish a relation <m>R</m> on <m>A</m> where <m>XRY</m> if and only if <m>X \subseteq Y</m>. This relation represents the idea of one set being a subset of another within the power set of <m>B</m>.
    </p>

    

    <p>
        To explore how elements relate within these examples, consider the element <m>\{1\}</m> in the context of the second example. The set <m>\{1\}</m> is not related to the empty set, denoted as <m>\{\}</m>, because <m>\{1\}</m> is not a subset of <m>\{\}</m>. Similarly, <m>\{1\}</m> does not relate to <m>\{0\}</m> because <m>\{1\}</m> is not a subset of <m>\{0\}</m>. However, <m>\{1\}</m> is related to <m>\{0,1\}</m> because <m>\{1\}</m> is indeed a subset of <m>\{0,1\}</m>, which we denote as <m>\{1\} R \{0,1\}</m>.

            P = Poset((A, lambda x, y: x.issubset(y)))
