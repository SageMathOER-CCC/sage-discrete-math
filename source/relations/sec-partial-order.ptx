    <title>Partial Order</title>
    <p>
        A Partial Order (PO) <m>\prec</m> satisfies the reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive properties.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            A = Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8])
            P = Poset((A, lambda x, y: x.divides(y)))
            P.plot()
        </input>
    </sage>

    <p>
        <em>Example:</em> Let <m>B = \{0,1\}</m> and define <m>A</m> as the power set of <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A = \mathcal{P}(B)</m>. Establish a relation <m>R</m> on <m>A</m> where <m>XRY</m> if and only if <m>X \subseteq Y</m>. This relation represents the idea of one set being a subset of another within the power set of <m>B</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To explore how elements relate within these examples, consider the element <m>\{1\}</m> in the context of the second example.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The set <m>\{1\}</m> is not related to the empty set, denoted as <m>\{\}</m>, because <m>\{1\}</m> is not a subset of <m>\{\}</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Similarly, <m>\{1\}</m> does not relate to <m>\{0\}</m> because <m>\{1\}</m> is not a subset of <m>\{0\}</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    However, <m>\{1\} R \{0,1\}</m> because <m>\{1\}</m> is indeed a subset of <m>\{0,1\}</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            B = Set([0, 1])
            A = B.subsets()

            P = Poset((A, lambda x, y: x.issubset(y)))

            # Increase size of vertices to fit the label
            P.plot(vertex_size=800)
        </input>
      </sage>

      <p>
        We can also define a poset by specifying the relation directly.
      </p>

      <sage>
        <input>
            H = Poset({0: [1, 2], 1: [3], 2: [3], 3: []})
            H.plot()
        </input>
