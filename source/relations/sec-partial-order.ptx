    <p>
        A relation <m>R</m> on a set is a Partial Order (PO) <m>\prec</m> if it satisfies the reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive properties. A poset is a set with a partial order relation. For example, the following set of numbers with a relation given by divisibility is a poset.

        <p>
            Partial orders are widely used in task scheduling and project management. For example, tasks within a project may have dependencies where certain tasks must be completed before others can start. This creates a partial order where tasks are arranged based on their dependencies, but not all tasks are directly related. Using a Hasse diagram helps visualize these relationships, allowing project managers to plan efficiently by identifying critical tasks and ensuring the correct order of operations, ultimately improving workflow and preventing bottlenecks.

    <p>
        A Hasse diagram is a simplified visual representation of a poset. Unlike a digraph, the relative position of vertices has meaning: if <m>x</m> relates to <m>y</m>,  then the vertex <m>x</m> appears lower in the drawing than the vertex <m>y</m>. Self-loops are assumed and not shown. Similarly, the diagram assumes the transitive property and does not explicitly display the edges that are implied by the transitive property.

    <p>
        If <m>R</m> is a partial order relation on <m>A</m>, then the function <c>Poset((A, R))</c> computes the Hasse diagram associated to <m>R</m>.

        Moreover, the <c>cover_relations()</c> function shows the pairs depicted in the Hasse diagram after the previous simplifications.
