    <p>
        A <term>relation</term> <m>R</m> from set <m>A</m> to set <m>B</m> is any subset of the Cartesian product <m>A \times B</m>, indicating that <m>R \subseteq A \times B</m>. We can ask Sage to decide if <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>. First, construct the Cartesian product <m>C = A \times B</m>. Then, build the set <m>S</m> of all subsets of <m>C</m>. Finally, ask if <m>R</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recall the Cartesian product consists of all possible ordered pairs <m>(a, b)</m>, where <m>a \in A</m> and <m>b \in B</m>. Each pair combines an element from set <m>A</m> with an element from set <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, an element in the set <m>A</m> relates to an element in <m>B</m> if the element from <m>A</m> is twice the element in <m>B</m>.

        <p> 
            Let <m>R</m> be a relation from a set <m>A</m> to a set <m>B</m> and <m>S</m> a relation from <m>B</m> to a set <m>C</m>. The composite of <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> is the relation consisting of the ordered pairs <m>(a,c)</m> where <m>a \in A</m> and <m>c \in C</m>, and for which there is a <m>b \in B</m> such that <m>(a,b) \in R</m> and <m>(b,c) \in S</m>. We denote the composite of <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> by <m>S \! \circ \! R</m>.

            We can also use Sage to compose relations.

        When <m>A = B</m> we refer to the relation as a relation <term>on</term> <m>A</m>.

    <p>
        Consider the set <m>A = \{2,3,4,6,8\}</m>. Let's define a relation <m>R</m> on <m>A</m> such that <m>aRb</m> if and only if <m>a | b</m> (<m>a</m> divides <m>b</m>). The relation <m>R</m> can be represented by the set of ordered pairs where the first element divides the second:
