    <title>Introduction to Relations</title>
    <p>
        A relation <m>R</m> from set <m>A</m> to set <m>B</m> is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product <m>A \times B</m>, represented as:
        <me>R \subseteq A \times B</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Cartesian product <m>A \times B</m> consists of all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from <m>A</m> and the second element is from <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Define a set pants and shirts
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            Pants = Set([('p1', 'athletic'), ('p2', 'formal'), ('p3', 'athletic'), ('p4', 'formal')])
            Shirts = Set([('s1', 'athletic'), ('s2', 'formal'), ('s3', 'athletic'), ('s4', 'formal')])
            all_combinations = Pants.cartesian_product(Shirts)
            # Iterate through the Cartesian product and print each combination
            for combo in all_combinations:
              print(combo)
        </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
        As you can see the Cartesian product of the sets <m>Pants</m> and <m>Shirts</m> consists of all possible ordered pairs combining elements from <m>Pants</m> with those from <m>Shirts</m>. If we want to make sure that the pants and shirts are matched according to their style, we can define a relation <m>R</m> as a subset of this Cartesian product.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's define a specific relation <m>R</m> as a subset of this Cartesian product:
        R = {('p1', 's1'), ('p2', 's2'), ('p3', 's3'), ('p4', 's4')}
    </p>
    <p>
        This relation can also be expressed using the relation symbol <m>R</m> as follows:
        <me>xR2, \; yR1, \; yR3, \; zR2</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that <m>x</m> is related to <m>2</m>, <m>y</m> is related to <m>1</m> and also to <m>3</m>, and <m>z</m> is related to <m>2</m>, according to the relation <m>R</m>.
