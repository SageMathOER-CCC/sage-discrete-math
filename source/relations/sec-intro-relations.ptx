    <title>Introduction to Relations</title>
    <p>
        A <term>relation</term> <m>R</m> from set <m>A</m> into set <m>B</m> is a subset of the Cartesian product <m>A \times B</m>, represented as:
        <me>R \subseteq A \times B</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Recall, the Cartesian product <m>A \times B</m> consists of all possible ordered pairs <m>(a, b)</m>, where <m>a \in A</m> and <m>b \in B</m>. Each pair combines an element from set <m>A</m> with an element from set <m>B</m>.
    </p>

        Let's define two sets, Pants and Shirts, as examples:
    </p>
    <p>
        <me>
            \text{Pants} = \{p_1, p_2, p_3\}
        </me>
        <me>
            \text{Shirts} = \{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\}
        </me>
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            # Define the sets of pants and shirts
            pants = Set(['p1', 'p2', 'p3'])
            shirts = Set(['s1', 's2', 's3', 's4'])

            # Define subsets for formal and athletic wear
            formal_pants = Set(['p1'])
            formal_shirts = Set(['s1', 's2'])
            athletic_pants = Set(['p2', 'p3'])
            athletic_shirts = Set(['s3', 's4'])

            print("formal_pants:", formal_pants)
            print("formal_shirts:", formal_shirts)
            print("athletic_pants:", athletic_pants)
            print("athletic_shirts:", athletic_shirts)
        </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Create a relation from Pants to Shirts based on style, where each pair of pants is matched with a shirt.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            # Define the formal relation
            formal_relation = Set([(a, b) for a in formal_pants for b in formal_shirts])

            # Define the athletic relation
            athletic_relation = Set([(a, b) for a in athletic_pants for b in athletic_shirts])

            print("Formal Relation:", formal_relation)
            print("Athletic Relation:", athletic_relation)
        </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
        The Cartesian product of Pants and Shirts includes all possible combinations of pants with shirts.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            # Create the Cartesian product
            cartesian_product = Set([(a, b) for a in pants for b in shirts])
            cartesian_product
        </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
        This relation of pants to shirts can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product of Pants and Shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <me>
            \text{formal_relation}  \subseteq \text{pants} \times \text{shirts}
        </me>
        <me>
            \text{athletic_relation}  \subseteq \text{pants} \times \text{shirts}
        </me>
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            # Check if each relation is a subset of the Cartesian product separately
            formal_is_subset = formal_relation.issubset(cartesian_product)
            athletic_is_subset = athletic_relation.issubset(cartesian_product)

            # Display the results
            print("Formal Relation Subset of Cartesian Product:", formal_is_subset)
            print("Athletic Relation Subset of Cartesian Product:", athletic_is_subset)
        </input>
