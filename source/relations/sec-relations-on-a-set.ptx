    <title>Relations on a set</title>

    <p>
        When <m>A = B</m> we refer to the relation as a relation <term>on</term> <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the set <m>A = \{2,3,4,6,8\}</m>. Let's define a relation <m>R</m> on <m>A</m> such that <m>aRb</m> iff <m>a | b</m> (<m>a</m> divides <m>b</m>). The relation <m>R</m> can be represented by the set of ordered pairs where the first element divides the second:

            A = Set([2, 3, 4, 6, 8])

            # Define the relation R on A: aRb iff a divides b
            R = Set([(a, b) for a in A for b in A if a.divides(b)])
