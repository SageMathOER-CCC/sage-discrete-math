    <title>Relations</title>
    <p>
        A relation <m>R</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is a subset of the cartesian product <m>A \times B</m>.
        <me>R \subseteq A \times B</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember a cartesian product is the set of pairs of elements in <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. A relation is any subset of all the possible pairs where the first component belongs to <m>A</m> and the second component belongs to <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's define sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>
        <me>A = \{x,y,z\}</me>
        <me>B = \{1,2,3,4\}</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets define a relation from A to B that is a subset of the cart product of
        <me>
            \{x,y,z\} \times \{1,2,3,4\}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        A relation can be any subset. In this example relation, lets say the pairs I am considering are
        <me>
            R = \{(x,2),(y,1),(y,3),(z,2)\}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        We can also express this as
        <me>
            xR2, yR1, yR3, zR2
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        This reads <m>X</m> relates to <m>2</m>, <m>y</m> relates to <m>1</m>, etc
    </p>

        Let's use another example relation. If the two sets are equal we say that a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>A</m> is called a relation <term>on</term> <m>A</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Example:</em> Let <m>A = \{2,3,4,6,8}</m> and <m>R</m> be the relation on <m>A</m> defined by <m>aRb</m> if <m>a</m> divides <m>b</m>. This is expressed as <m>a | b</m>
        <me>
            R = \{(2,2),(2,4),(2,6),(2,8),(3, 3),(3, 6),(4,4),(4,8),(6,6),(8, 8)\}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        To make sense of the pairs in this relation we can ask does <m>2</m> divide <m>2</m>? Yes. <m>2</m> does not divide <m>3</m> so it is not included. Next, we see that <m>2</m> divides <m>4</m>, and we continue with this pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can use a digraph to represent a relation on a set. A relation "on" is the relation of a set on itself. Create a node (vertex) for each element of the set. Use arrows pointing to nodes to represent the direction of the relation from one element to another. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: Let <m>A = \{1,2,3\}</m> and <m>R</m> be the relation of <m>A</m> defined by <m>aRb</m> if <m>a < b</m>.
    </p>

Notes:

Let A = {1,2,3} and R be the following relation of A
a R b iff a < b
Digraph and notations

Let B = {0,1} and A = PowerSetSymbol(B) and R be the following relation on A: 
X R Y iff X âŠ† Y (X is contained / a subset of Y)

Lets pick an element to see how it relates

{1} is not related to the empty set because the set 1 is not a subset of the empty set

What about {1} and {0}, not contained

{1} R {0,1}
