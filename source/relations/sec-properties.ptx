       A relation R on set A may or may not satisfy the following properties:
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Reflexive</term>: a relates to a for all elements a in the set A. All the elements relate to themselves.
        <me>
            aRa \quad \forall a \in A
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Symmetric</term>: if a relates to b, then b relates to a. The relation is symmetric if the order of the elements does not matter.
        <me>
            \text{If } aRb \text{ then } bRa \quad \forall a, b \in A
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Antisymmetric</term>: The only case that a relates to be and b relates to a is when a and b are equal.
        <me>
            \text{If } aRb \text{ and } bRa \text{ then } a = b \quad \forall a, b \in A
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Transitive</term>: if a relates to b and b relates to c, then a relates to c.
        <me>
            \text{If } aRb \text{ and } bRc \text{ then } aRc \quad \forall a, b, c \in A
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        A relation is called an <term>equivalence relation</term> if the relation satisfies the following properties: reflexive symmetric and transitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Class of equivalence</term> is defined by
        <me>
            [a] = \{x \in A | aRx\}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        In plain english, the class of equivalence of a is the set of all elements in A that are related to a.
    </p>
    <p>
        <me>
            \text{Let A } = \{x | x \text{ is a person living in USA} \}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let R be the following relation on A:
    </p>
    <p>
        x R y if and only if x and y live in the same building.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Reflexive</term>: A person lives in the same building as himself. This is true for everybody living in USA.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Symmetric</term>: If person x lives in the same building as person y, then person y lives in the same building as person x.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Transitive</term>: If person x lives in the same building as person y and person y lives in the same building as person z, then person x lives in the same building as person z.
                </p>
