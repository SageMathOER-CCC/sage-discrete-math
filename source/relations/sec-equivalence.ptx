    <title>Equivalence</title>
    <p>
        A relation is called an <term>equivalence relation</term> if the relation satisfies the following properties: reflexive symmetric and transitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Class of equivalence</term> is defined by
        <me>
            |a| = \{x \in A \; | \; xRa\}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        The class of equivalence of a is the set of all elements in A that are related to a.
    </p>
    <p>
        <me>
            \text{Let A } = \{x \; | \; x \text{ is a person living in a building} \}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let R be the following relation on A:
    </p>
    <me>
        \text{x R y iff x and y live in the same floor of the building.}
    </me>
    
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Reflexive</term>: A person lives in the same floor as themselves.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Symmetric</term>: If person x lives in the same floor as person y, then person y lives in the same floor as person x.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Transitive</term>: If person x lives in the same floor as person y and person y lives in the same floor as person z, then person x lives in the same floor as person z.

        Class of equivalence:
