    <title>Equivalence</title>
    <p>
        A relation is called an <term>equivalence relation</term> if it satisfies three key properties: <term>reflexivity</term>, <term>symmetry</term>, and <term>transitivity</term>. These properties ensure that elements can be grouped into classes of equivalence based on their mutual relations.

                    a relates to a for all elements a in the set A. All the elements relate to themselves.

    <p>
        The <term>class of equivalence</term> for an element a in set A is defined by the set:
    </p>
    <me>
        |a| = \{x \in A \; | \; xRa\}
    </me>
    <p>
        This set comprises all elements in A that are related to a through the relation R, illustrating how elements are grouped into equivalence classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider set A as defined by the scenario:
    </p>
    <p>
        <me>
            \text{Let A } = \{x \; | \; x \text{ is a person living in a given building} \}
        </me>
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            # Define the set of people and their respective floors using SageMath Set
            A = Set(["p_1", "p_2", "p_3", "p_4", "p_5", "p_6", "p_7", "p_8", "p_9", "p_10"])
            A
        </input>
    </sage>

    <p>
        In this context, let R be the relation on A described as follows:
    </p>
    <me>
        \text{x R y iff x and y live in the same floor of the building.}
    </me>
    <sage>
        <input>
            # Define subsets for people living on the same floor
            first_floor = Set(["p_1", "p_2", "p_3", "p_4"])
            second_floor = Set(["p_5", "p_6", "p_7"])
            third_floor = Set(["p_8", "p_9", "p_10"])
            print("first_floor:", first_floor)
            print("second_floor:", second_floor)
            print("third_floor:", third_floor)
        </input>
    </sage>


    <sage>
        <input>
            # Define the first floor relation
            first_floor_relation = Set([(a, b) for a in first_floor for b in first_floor])

            # Define the second floor relation
            second_floor_relation = Set([(a, b) for a in second_floor for b in second_floor])

            # Define the third floor relation
            third_floor_relation = Set([(a, b) for a in third_floor for b in third_floor])

            print("first_floor_relation:", first_floor_relation)
            print("second_floor_relation:", second_floor_relation)
            print("third_floor_relation:", third_floor_relation)
        </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
        This relation demonstrates the properties of an equivalence relation:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Reflexive</term>: A person lives in the same floor as themselves.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Symmetric</term>: If person x lives in the same floor as person y, then person y lives in the same floor as person x.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Transitive</term>: If person x lives in the same floor as person y and person y lives in the same floor as person z, then person x lives in the same floor as person z.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
        </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
        For the class of equivalence, considering person a as an example:
    </p>
    <me>
        | \text{person a} | = \{ x \in A \; | \; x R a \} = \text{all people living on the same floor as person a}
    </me>
    <p>
        This definition shows that the class of equivalence for person a includes all individuals residing on the same floor as a. The relation "living on the same floor as" groups the building's residents into sets, with each set corresponding to a floor, forming an equivalence class.
