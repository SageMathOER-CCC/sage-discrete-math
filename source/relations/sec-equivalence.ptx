    <p>
        A relation is called an <term>equivalence relation</term> if the relation satisfies the following properties: reflexive symmetric and transitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        <term>Class of equivalence</term> is defined by

            |a| = \{x \in A \; | \; aRx\}

    </p>
    <p>
        The class of equivalence of a is the set of all elements in A that are related to a.

        Let R be the following relation on A:
    </p>
    <p>
        x R y iff x and y live in the same building.

                <p>
                    <term>Reflexive</term>: A person lives in the same building as himself. This is true for everybody living in USA.

            <li>
                <p>
                    <term>Symmetric</term>: If person x lives in the same building as person y, then person y lives in the same building as person x.
