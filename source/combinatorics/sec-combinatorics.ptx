        <title>Factorial Function</title>
        <p>
            The factorial of a non-negative integer <m>n</m>, denoted by <m>n!</m>, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to <m>n</m>. In SageMath, the <c>factorial()</c> function computes this value, which is essential in permutations and combinations calculations.

            <p>
                Factorials are widely used in probability problems, such as determining the number of possible ways a set of items can be arranged.

            For example, to compute the factorial of 5:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                factorial(5)
            </input>

        <title>Binomial Coefficient</title>
        <p>
            The binomial coefficient <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> represents the number of ways to choose <m>k</m> elements out of a set of <m>n</m> elements without considering the order. In SageMath, the <c>binomial()</c> function calculates this value, which is crucial for combinatorial problems.
        </p>

            <title>Tips!</title>
            <p>
                Binomial coefficients are useful in scenarios like determining the number of possible committees that can be formed from a larger group.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            For instance, to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of 5:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                binomial(5, 3)
            </input>

    <!-- Permutations Subsection -->
    <subsection>
        <title>Permutations</title>
        <p>
            A permutation of a set is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order. SageMath's <c>Permutations()</c> function generates all possible permutations of a set. To list all sets in a permutation, you can convert the output to a list.
        </p>

            <title>Tips!</title>
            <p>
                Understanding permutations can help solve problems like scheduling where the order of tasks or events matters.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            To illustrate, generating all permutations of the set {1, 2, 3}:
        </p>
        <sage>
            <input>
                A = Permutations([1, 2, 3])
                list(A)
            </input>
            <output></output>
        </sage>
