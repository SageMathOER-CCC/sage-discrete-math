    Given a graph, a <term>cycle</term> is a circuit with no repeated edges. A <term>tree</term> is a connected graph with no cycles. A graph with no cycles and not necessarily connected is called a <term>forest</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>G = (M, E)</m> be a graph. The following are all equivalent:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> is a tree.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For each pair of distinct vertices, there exists a unique path between them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> is connected, and if <m>e \in E</m> then the graph <m>(V, E - {e})</m> is disconnected.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> contains no cycles, but by adding one edge, you create a cycle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> is connected and <m>|E| = |v| - 1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's explore the following graph:
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      data = {
        1: [4],
        2: [3, 4, 5],
        3: [2],
        4: [1, 2, 6, 7],
        5: [2, 8],
        6: [4, 9, 11],
        7: [4],
        8: [5, 10],
        9: [6],
        10: [8],
        11: [6]
        }

      G = Graph(data)
      G.show()
    </input>
  </sage>

    <p>
      Trees are a common data structure used in file explorers, parsers, and decision making.

  <p>
    Let's ask Sage if this graph is a tree.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G.is_tree()
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    If we remove an edge, we can see that the graph is no longer a tree.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      G_removed_edge = G.copy()
      G_removed_edge.delete_edge((1, 4))
      G_removed_edge.show()
      G_removed_edge.is_tree()
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    However, we can see that the graph is still a forest.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G_removed_edge.is_forest()
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    If we add an edge, we can see that the graph contains a cycle and is no longer a tree.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      G_added_edge = G.copy()
      G_added_edge.add_edge((1, 2))
      G_added_edge.show()
      G_added_edge.is_tree()
    </input>
  </sage>
