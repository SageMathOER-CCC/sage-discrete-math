    Given a graph, a <term>cycle</term> is a circuit with no repeated edges. A <term>tree</term> is a connected graph with no cycles. A graph with no cycles and not necessarily connected is called a <term>forest</term>.

    Let <m>G = (M, E)</m> be a graph. The following are all equivalent:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> is a tree.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For each pair of distinct vertices, there exists a unique path between them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> is connected, and if <m>e \in E</m> then the graph <m>(V, E - {e})</m> is disconnected.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> contains no cycles, but by adding one edge, you create a cycle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>G</m> is connected and <m>|E| = |v| - 1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
