            Imagine your task is to create a railway between all the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) campus locations. The contract requests that you use minimal track material to save construction costs. For simplicity's sake, assume each railway is a straight line.

            Since the Earth is curved, we cannot use the hypotenuse. We will use the Haversine formula instead. Note that the Haversine formula still produces an approximation because the Earth is not a perfect sphere. Here is a function to compute the Haversine formula.

            Now we can make an edge <c>list</c>. We will represent each campus as a node with the initials of the college name. The weight of the edge will represent the Haversine value between the locations. For example, express the route between Harold Washington College and Harry S Truman College as <c>("HW", "HT", Haversine)</c>.

            So far, we have encountered various concepts for connecting a graph's vertices, including a Hamilton path and a minimum spanning tree. Let's consider what technique is best suited for solving the problem of constructing a railway that optimizes material costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The previous chapter used the traveling salesperson algorithm to optimize a delivery route. Since we aim to optimize material costs, you might think of following a similar approach: apply the traveling salesperson algorithm, eliminate the greatest edge from the Hamilton circuit, and design the railway with the minimum Hamilton path. While the Hamiltonian path optimizes graph traversal by visiting each vertex exactly once in a single path, it does not necessarily guarantee that all vertices are connected with the minimal total weight.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a Hamiltonian path, the requirement to visit each vertex in a single path can force the inclusion of high-weight edges. Alternatively, a minimum spanning tree is not restricted by the requirement of connecting vertices with a path. A minimum spanning tree can avoid high-weight edges by connecting vertices without regard to forming a path as long as the graph remains connected and acyclic. Although the minimum Hamilton path is one of many possible spanning trees, it is not a minimum spanning tree. Prim's Algorithm ensures the weight of the spanning tree is minimal because, at each iteration, it selects the smallest-weight edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may want to create a railway that optimizes travel time and construction material costs in a real-world situation. When ignoring the downtown Loop, the Chicago L train system resembles a tree and is criticized for its lack of interconnectivity. For example, finding an efficient route connecting the end of the Blue Line with the end of the Red Line is challenging. In this challenge question, We will optimize construction material costs for simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's find the minimum spanning tree edge <c>list</c> of the campus locations with the <c>min_spanning_tree(by_weight=True)</c> function.
