  <title>Paths</title>

    <h>path</h>
  </idx>
  <p> A path between two vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is a sequence of consecutive edges starting
    at <m>u</m> and ending at <m>v</m>. </p>
  <p>
    To get all paths between two vertices:
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [3], 3: [4]})
      G.show()
      G.all_paths(1, 4)
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    The length of a path is defined as the number of edges that make up the path.
  </p>
  <p> Finding the shortest path between two vertices can be achieved using the <c>shortest_path()</c>
    function: </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [3], 3: [4]})
      G.show()
      G.shortest_path(1, 4)
    </input>
  </sage>
  <idx>
    <h>connected</h>
  </idx>
  <p>
    A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between any two vertices in the graph.
  </p>
  <p> To determine if a graph is connected, we can use the <c>is_connected()</c> function: </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [3], 3: [4]})
      G.show()
      G.is_connected()
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p> A connected component of a graph <m>G</m> is a maximal connected subgraph of <m>G</m>. If
    the graph <m>G</m> is connected, then it has only one connected component. </p>
  <p>
    For example, the following graph is not connected:
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 5: [6]})
      G.show()
      G.is_connected()
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p> To identify all connected components of a graph, the <c>connected_components()</c> function
    can be utilized: </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 5: [6]})
      G.show()
      G.connected_components()
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    We can visualize the graph as a disjoint union of its connected components, by plotting it.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 5: [6, 7], 6: [7]})
      G.show()
    </input>
  </sage>
  <idx>
    <h>diameter</h>
  </idx>
  <p>
    The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest path among all of a graph's shortest paths between any two vertices.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [3, 4], 3: [4]})
      G.show()

      # Calculates the diameter of the graph.
      G.diameter()
    </input>
  </sage>
  <idx>
    <h>bipartite</h>
  </idx>
  <p>
    A graph is bipartite if its set of vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that
    every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set:
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      G = Graph({1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: [4]})
      G.show()
      G.is_bipartite()
      print("Bipartite sets:")
      G.bipartite_sets()
    </input>
