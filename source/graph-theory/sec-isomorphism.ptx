  <title>Isomorphism</title>
  <p>
    Informally, we can say that an <term>isomorphism</term> is a relation of sameness between graphs. Let's say that the graphs <m>G = (V, E)</m> and <m>G' = (V', E')</m> are isomorphic if there exists a bijection <m>f: V \rightarrow V'</m> such that <m>\{u, v\} \in E \Leftrightarrow \{f(u), f(v)\} \in E'</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means there is a bijection between the set of vertices such that every time two vertices determine an edge in the first graph, the image of these vertices by the bijection also determines an edge in the second graph, and vice versa. Essentially, the two graphs have the same structure, but the vertices are labeled differently.

      In chemistry, isomorphism is crucial in the study of molecules. Chemical isomers have the same molecular formula but different structures (or graphs), affecting their chemical properties and reactions. Understanding graph isomorphism helps chemists identify and differentiate these molecules efficiently.

    The sage <c>is_isomorphic()</c> method can be used to check if two graphs are isomorphic. The method returns <c>True</c> if the graphs are isomorphic and <c>False</c> if the graphs are not isomorphic.

    The <term>invariants under isomorphism</term> are conditions that can be checked to determine if two graphs are not isomorphic. If one of these fails then the graphs are not isomorphic. If all of these are true then the graph may or may not be isomorphic. The three conditions for invariants under isomorphism are:
    <me>
      G = (V, E) \text{ is connected iff } G' = (V', E') \text{ is connected}
    </me>
    <me>
      |V| = |V'| \text{ and } |E| = |E'|
    </me>
    <me>
      \text{degree sequence of } G = \text{ degree sequence of } G'
    </me>

      Graph isomorphism has implications in computer science, particularly in data mining and machine learning. Algorithms that detect isomorphisms can help identify similar data structures in databases, facilitating the classification and clustering of data based on structural similarity.

    To summarize, if one graph is connected and the other is not, then the graphs are not isomorphic. If the number of vertices and edges are different, then the graphs are not isomorphic. If the degree sequences are different, then the graphs are not isomorphic. If all three invariants are satisfied, then the graphs may or may not be isomorphic.

    Let's define a function to check if two graphs satisfy the invariants under isomorphism. Make sure you run the next cell to define the function before using the function.

      Network theory uses graph isomorphism to analyze and understand different networks, such as social networks or communication networks. By identifying isomorphic subgraphs, researchers can detect patterns and anomalies across different network systems.

    If we use <c>invariants_under_isomorphism</c> on the <m>C</m> and <m>D</m>, the output will let us know that the graphs may or may not be isomorphic. We can use the <c>is_isomorphic()</c> method to check if the graphs are definitively isomorphic.
