            <title>Definition</title>
            <p>
                A lattice is defined as a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a unique supremum (also known as join) and infimum (also known as meet). This section introduces lattices and discusses their significance.

            <p>
                In Sage, a lattice can be represented as a poset using the <c>Poset()</c> function. This function takes a tuple as its argument, where the first element is a set of elements in the poset, and the second element is a list of ordered pairs representing the partial order relations between those elements. The <c>cover_relations=True</c> parameter tells Sage to compute the covering relations automatically, which simplifies the definition of the poset and ensures that the graphical representation reflects the direct connections between elements, aiding in the visualization of the lattice structure.

            <p>
                The join of two elements in a lattice is the least upper bound of those elements. To find the join of a lattice, we use <c>is_join_semilattice()</c> function.

                The meet of two elements in a lattice is their greatest lower bound. To find the meet of a lattice, we use <c>is_meet_semilattice()</c> function.
