    Sage comes with many built-in functions. Math terminology is not always standard, so be sure to read the documentation to learn what these functions do and how to use them. In Sage, you can also define your own functions. Defining a function in Sage is similar to defining a function in Python.
  </p>
  <p>
    To define a function in Sage, use the <c>def</c> keyword followed by the function name and the function's arguments. The function's body is indented. The <c>return</c> keyword is used to return a value from the function.

    You may have heard of Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. Here is a function that returns the <m>n^{th}</m> (0-indexed) row of Pascal's Triangle:
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      def print_pascal_row(n):
          return [binomial(n, i) for i in range(n + 1)]
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    Try calling the function for yourself. Be sure to run the Sage cell with the function definition first to define the function and use it in other cells. When you run the cell that defines the function, you won't see any output. You will only see output when you call the function. After running the above cell, you can call the <c>print_pascal_row()</c> function.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      print_pascal_row(5)
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    You can also add input validation to your functions to make them more robust.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>

    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    Try calling the function with invalid input to see the input validation in action.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    Functions can also include a <c>docstring</c> to provide documentation for the function. The <c>docstring</c> is a string that appears as the first statement in the function body. It is used to describe what the function does and how to use it.
