  <title>Object-Oriented Programming</title>

  <p>
    <term>Object-Oriented Programming</term> (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models the world as a collection of interacting <term>objects</term>. More specifically, an object is an <term>instance</term> of a <term>class</term>. A class can represent almost anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Classes</term> are like blueprints that define the structure and behavior of objects. A class defines the <term>attributes</term> and <term>methods</term> of an object. An attribute is a variable that stores information about the object. A method is a function that can interact with or modify the object. Although you can create your own custom classes, the open-source community has already defined thousands of classes for us to use. For example, there are specialized classes for working with integers, lists, strings, graphs, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's use these new terms to describe the following example.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
      vowels
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    In Python and Sage, almost everything is an object. When assigning a value to a variable, the variable references an object. In this case, the object is a list of strings.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      type_element = type('a')
      type_vowels = type(vowels)

      print(f"The type of the element 'a' is: {type_element}")
      print(f"The type of the variable vowels is: {type_vowels}")
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    The <c>type()</c> function confirms that <c>'a'</c> is an instance of the <c>string</c> class and <c>vowels</c> is an instance of the <c>list</c> class. We create a <c>list</c> object named <c>vowels</c> by assigning a series of characters within square brackets to a variable. This object, <c>vowels</c>, now represents a <c>list</c> of <c>string</c> elements, and we can interact with it using various methods.
  </p>

  <p>
    <term>Dot notation</term> is a syntax used to access an object's attributes and call an object's methods. For example, the list class has an <c>append</c> method, allowing us to add elements to the list.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      vowels.append('y')
      vowels
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>    
    A <term>parameter</term> is a variable passed to a method. In this case, the parameter is the string <c>'y'</c>. The <c>append</c> method adds the string <c>'y'</c> to the end of the list. The list class has many more methods that we can use to interact with the list object. While <c>list</c> is a built-in Python class, Sage offers many more classes specialized for mathematical applications. For example, we will learn about the Sage <c>Set</c> class in the next chapter. Objects instantiated from the <c>Set</c> class have methods and attributes useful for working with sets.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      v = Set(vowels)
      type(v)
    </input>
  </sage>
  
  <p>
    While OOP might seem abstract at first, it will become clearer as we dive deeper into Sage. We will see how Sage utilizes OOP principles and built-in classes to offer a structured way to represent data and perform powerful mathematical operations.
