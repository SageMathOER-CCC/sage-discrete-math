    <title>Miscellaneous Features</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Sage is feature rich, and the following is a brief introduction to some of its miscellaneous
            features. Keep in mind that the primary goal of this book is to introduce Sage software and
            demonstrate how it can be used to experiment with discrete math concepts within Sage environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sage is used here interactively, and mainly covering the basics. Having an understanding of
            any of the commands presented in this section would be crucial for working on a production-grade
            project with complex mathematical models (e.g. handling large datasets). In such cases, it would
            be more appropriate to use these commands within a standalone Sage environment. These commands
            are presented here just for the sake of completeness.

    <subsection xml:id="reading-writing-files">
        <title>Reading and Writing Files in Sage</title>
            <p>Sage provides various ways to handle input and output (I/O) operations.</p>
            <p>This subsection explores writing data to files and importing data from files.</p>

            <p>Sage allows reading from and writing to files using standard Python file-handling functions.</p>

            <p>
            <em>Writing to a file:</em>
        </p>
        <sage>
        <input>
            with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
                file.write("Hello, Sage!")
        </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            <em>Reading from a file:</em>
        </p>
        <sage>
        <input>
            with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
                content = file.read()
                print(content)  # Output: Hello, Sage!
        </input>
        </sage>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="shell-commands-in-sage">
        <title>Executing Shell Commands in Sage</title>

        <p>Sage allows executing shell commands directly using the `!` operator (prefix the shell command to be executed).</p>

        <p>
            <em>Listing the content of the current directory showing the file that we just created:</em>
        </p>
        <sage>
        <input>
            !ls -la
        </input>
        </sage>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="import-export-csv-json">
        <title>Importing and Exporting Data (CSV, JSON, TXT)</title>

        <p>Sage supports structured data formats such as CSV and JSON.</p>

        <p>
            <em>Generating a CSV file using shell command:</em>
        </p>
        <sage>
        <input>
            !printf "Name,Age,Country\nAlice,25,USA\nBob,30,UK\nCharlie,28,Canada\n" > data.csv
        </input>
        </sage>

        <p>
            <em>Reading a CSV file in Sage:</em>
        </p>
        <sage>
        <input>
            import csv

            with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
                reader = csv.reader(file)
                for row in reader:
                    print(row)
        </input>
        </sage>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="external-libraries">
        <title>Using External Libraries in Sage</title>
        <p>Sage allows using external Python libraries to do advance calculation or access and communicate over a network (urllib.request library) .</p>

        <p>
            <em>Using NumPy for numerical computations:</em>
        </p>
    <sage>
    <input>
        import numpy as np
        array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
        print(array)  # Output: [1 2 3]
    </input>
