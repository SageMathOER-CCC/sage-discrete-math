  <introduction>
    <p> Welcome to our introduction to SageMath. This chapter is designed for learners of all backgroundsâ€”whether you're new to programming or aiming to expand your mathematical toolkit. Running your first line of code is streamlined through the platform of CoCalc Sage worksheets, enabling you to execute code directly in your browser with minimal set up and installation. </p>

    <p>
      We'll cover the basics, including SageMath's syntax, data types, variables, and debugging techniques. Our goal is to equip you with the foundational knowledge needed to explore mathematical problems and programming concepts in an accessible and straightforward manner.
