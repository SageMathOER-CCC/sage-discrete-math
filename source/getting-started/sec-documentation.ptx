        Sage can do many more mathematical operations. If you are curious, check out the <url href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/quickref">Quick Reference Card</url> and the <url href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/">Reference Manual</url>.

        If you want to view the documentation for a function, you can type the function followed by a <c>?</c>. Are you interested in viewing the source code? Run a function followed by <c>??</c>. Let take a look at the definition of the <c>Primes()</c> function. Keep in mind, this way of checking documentation is not always the most beginner friendly, but it can serve as a quick reference or reminder.
