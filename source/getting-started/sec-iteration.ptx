    <title>Iteration</title>
    <p>
        Iteration is used to create loops that allow a program to repeat a sequence of instructions until a certain condition is met. In a for loop, the loop variable is assigned a value from a sequence, and the body of the loop is executed once for each value.

        <input>
            # Print the numbers from 0 to 49
            # Notice that 50 is not included
            for i in range(50):
                print(i)
        </input>
    </sage>

    <sage>
        <input>
            # The starting value of the range is included, unlike the ending value
            for i in range(20, 50):
                print(i)
        </input>
    </sage>

    <sage>
        <input>
            # We can also specify a step value
            for i in range(20, 50, 9):
                print(i)
        </input>

        Lists are often used in iteration. Here is an example of list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists.

    <sage>
        <input>
            # Create a list of the cube roots of the numbers from 9 to 100
            # In list comprehension, the for loop is written inside the square
            # Unlike the range function, the ending value is included in the range
            [n**3 for n in [9..100]]
        </input>
