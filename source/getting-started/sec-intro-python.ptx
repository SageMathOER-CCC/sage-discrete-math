  <title>Introduction to Python Programming</title>

  <p>Python is a versatile programming language used for a wide range of applications. understanding Python basics is essential for effective use of SageMath.</p>

  <p>SageMath is a Python-based system, integrating various open-source mathematics software packages. Learning Python allows users to fully utilize SageMath and equips them with broader applicable skills.</p>

    <title>Basic Data Types in Python</title>
    <p>Python has several built-in data types. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Integers</em>: Whole numbers without a fractional part. Example: <c>42</c>, <c>-7</c>.</li>
      <li><em>Floats</em>: Numbers with a decimal point. Example: <c>3.14</c>, <c>-0.001</c>.</li>
      <li><em>Strings</em>: Sequence of characters used for text. Example: <c>"Hello"</c>, <c>'World'</c>.</li>
      <li><em>Booleans</em>: Represents truth values. Only two possible objects: <c>True</c> and <c>False</c>.</li>
      <li><em>Lists</em>: Ordered, mutable collections of items. Example: <c>[1, 2, 3]</c>.</li>
      <li><em>Tuples</em>: Ordered, immutable collections. Example: <c>(1, 2, 3)</c>.</li>
      <li><em>Dictionaries</em>: Collections of key-value pairs. Example: <c>{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}</c>.</li>
    </ul>

    <title>Reserved Words in Python and SageMath</title>
    <p>Reserved words, or keywords, in Python are words that have special syntactic significance and cannot be used as identifiers for variables, functions, classes, or any other naming purposes. They are the building blocks of Python syntax and program structure.</p>
    
    <p>In Python, these reserved words include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Control flow keywords like <c>if</c>, <c>else</c>, <c>elif</c>, <c>while</c>, <c>for</c>, <c>break</c>, <c>continue</c>, <c>return</c>, <c>try</c>, <c>except</c>, <c>finally</c>, and <c>raise</c>.</li>
        <li>Function and class-related keywords such as <c>def</c>, <c>class</c>, and <c>lambda</c>.</li>
        <li>Logical operators like <c>and</c>, <c>or</c>, and <c>not</c>.</li>
        <li>Other keywords including <c>True</c>, <c>False</c>, <c>None</c>, <c>in</c>, <c>is</c>, <c>async</c>, <c>await</c>, and others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's important for Python programmers, especially those new to the language, to recognize these keywords and understand their special functions within the language.</p>

    <p>In the context of SageMath, the situation is slightly different. While SageMath is built upon Python, it also introduces additional functions and objects specific to mathematical computing. Some Python keywords might have additional functionalities or be used in specific mathematical contexts within SageMath. However, the core Python keywords retain their original meanings and should be treated with the same syntactic care as in standard Python programming.</p>
