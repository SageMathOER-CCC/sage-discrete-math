  <p>
    Error messages are an inevitable part of programming for all levels of experience. With the right mindset, mistakes are valuable learning opportunities that help us develop our skills. Try to get comfortable making mistakes and embrace experimentation as part of the learning process. With experience, your debugging skills will improve. Reading error messages is a critical skill. While some error messages are helpful and descriptive, others may seem cryptic or confusing. However, with practice, error messages will become easier to understand. Let's dive in and make some mistakes together!

  <sage>
    <input>
      # Run this cell and see what happens
      1message = "Hello, World!"
      print(1message)
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    Why didn't this print <c>Hello, World!</c> on the screen? The error message informed us of a <c>SyntaxError</c>. While the phrase <c>invalid decimal literal</c> may seem confusing, the key issue here is the invalid variable name. Valid identifiers must start with a letter or underscore. They cannot begin with a number or use any special characters. Let's correct the variable name by using a valid identifier.

  <sage>
    <input>
      message = "Hello, World!"
      print(message)
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    Here is another error:
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      print(Hi)
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    In this case, we encounter a <c>NameError</c> because <c>Hi</c> is not defined. Sage assumes that <c>Hi</c> is a variable because there are no quotes. We can make <c>Hi</c> a string by enclosing it in quotes to fix this.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      print("Hi")
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    Alternatively, if we intended <c>Hi</c> to be a variable, we can assign a value to it before printing.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      Hi = "Hello, World!"
      print(Hi)
    </input>
  </sage>
