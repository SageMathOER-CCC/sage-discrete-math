    When you learn how to program you will make many mistakes. This will always be part of the process. Please try your best to get comfortable with making mistakes and experimenting. Over time you will learn to recognize how to correct these mistakes quicker. Reading error messages is an essential element of programming. Sometimes error messages are helpful and descriptive. Other times they will seem confusing and will become more clear over time and with practice. Let's make some mistakes together!

  <sage>
    <input>
      # Run this cell and see what happens
      1message = "Hello, World!"
      print(1message)
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    Why didn't this print <c>Hello, World!</c> to the screen? Sage told us we have a <c>SyntaxError</c>. In this case we are not too concerned with the meaning of <c>invalid decimal literal</c>. The problem is with how we named our variable. We must use valid identifiers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's use an acceptable identifier to name our variable.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      message = "Hello, World!"
      print(message)
    </input>
  </sage>

  
  
  <p>
    Here is another error:
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      print(Hi)
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    It looks like we have a <c>NameError</c> because <c>Hi</c> is not defined. In this case Sage thinks that <c>Hi</c> is a variable because there are no quotes around it. Let's make it a string by adding quotes around it.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      print("Hi")
    </input>
  </sage>
  <p>
    Alternately, we could have kept <c>Hi</c> without quotes to use it as a variable and assign a value to it.
  </p>
  <sage>
    <input>
      Hi = "Hello, World!"
      print(Hi)
    </input>
  </sage>
