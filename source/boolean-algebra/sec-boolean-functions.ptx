    <title>Boolean functions</title>
    <p>
        A Boolean function refers to a function having <m>n</m> number of entries or variables, so it has <m>2n</m> number of possible combinations of the given variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        In SageMath, Boolean functions can be manipulated through various built-in functions designed for handling Boolean variables and expressions.

          Boolean algebra is crucial in digital circuit design. For example, simplifying the expression of a digital circuit can minimize the number of gates used, which reduces cost and power consumption. Techniques such as Karnaugh maps and Boolean simplification are common in the industry.
