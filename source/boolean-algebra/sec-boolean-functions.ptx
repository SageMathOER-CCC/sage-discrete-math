        A  Boolean function is a function that takes only values 0 or 1 and whose domain is the Cartesian product <m>{\{0, 1\}^n}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In SageMath, Boolean functions can be manipulated through various built-in functions designed for handling Boolean variables and expressions.

          Boolean algebra is crucial in digital circuit design. For example, simplifying the expression of a digital circuit can minimize the number of gates used, which reduces cost and power consumption. Techniques such as Karnaugh maps and Boolean simplification are common in the industry.

        Before we begin lets import the necessary modules. This will reduce the amount of code we need to type.

    <sage>
        <input>
            from sage.logic.propcalc import formula

        Now let's examine the truth table of the Boolean function <m>h(x, y) = x + \bar{y}</m>.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            h = formula("x | ~y")
            h.truthtable()
        </input>

        Every Boolean function can be written as a sum-of-products expansion by applying the Boolean identities. Let's find the sum-of-products expansion of the Boolean function <m>h(x, y) = x + \bar{y}</m>.

            B = BooleanPolynomialRing(3, 'x')
            f = B('x0 + x1 * x2')
            show(f)

        <output>
