    > A Boolean function is a function that takes only values 0 or 1 and whose domain is the
        Cartesian product <m>{\{0, 1\}^n}</m>. </p>
    <p>
        In SageMath, Boolean functions can be manipulated through various built-in functions
        designed for handling Boolean variables and expressions.

            Boolean algebra is crucial in digital circuit design. For example, simplifying the
            expression of a digital circuit can minimize the number of gates used, which reduces
            cost and power consumption. Techniques such as Karnaugh maps and Boolean simplification
            are common in the industry.
