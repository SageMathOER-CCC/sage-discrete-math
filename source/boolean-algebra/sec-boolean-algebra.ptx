    <p>
        Boolean algebra is the algebra of two-valued logic with only sentential connectives, or equivalently of algebras of sets under union and complementation.
    </p>

        A common structure analyzed in Boolean algebra is the lattice. Below, we show how to work with a divisor lattice, which is a specific type of lattice useful in various mathematical computations.

            In computer software, Boolean algebra is used to construct and simplify expressions in programming languages that support logical decision-making processes. This simplification is critical in developing efficient algorithms and software that perform millions of calculations and logical operations per second.

    <sage>
        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.show()
        </input>
        <output>
            # This will display the lattice structure for divisors of the number 20.

        The following Sage cell checks whether the divisor lattice is distributive. A distributive lattice is one where the operations of join and meet distribute over each other.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.is_distributive()
        </input>
        <output>
            # Returns True if the lattice is distributive, along with a certificate if applicable.
        </output>
    </sage>

            In digital electronics, the principles of Boolean algebra guide the design of circuits such as multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, and decoders, essential components in telecommunications and signal processing.

        Another important property in Boolean algebra is the complemented lattice. A complemented lattice is one where every element has a complement in the lattice.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.is_complemented()
        </input>
        <output>
            # Returns True if the lattice is complemented, along with a certificate if applicable.
        </output>
    </sage>
