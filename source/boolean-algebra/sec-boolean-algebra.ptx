        A Boolean algebra is a bounded lattice that is both complemented and distributive.

            In computer software, Boolean algebra is used to construct and simplify expressions in
            programming languages that support logical decision-making processes. This
            simplification is critical in developing efficient algorithms and software that perform
            millions of calculations and logical operations per second.

        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.show()
        </input>
        <output>
            # This will display the lattice structure for divisors of the number 20.

        The following Sage cell checks whether the divisor lattice is distributive. A distributive
        lattice is one where the operations of join and meet distribute over each other.

    <sage>
        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.is_distributive()
        </input>
        <output>
            # Returns True if the lattice is distributive, along with a certificate if applicable.
        </output>

            In digital electronics, the principles of Boolean algebra guide the design of circuits
            such as multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, and decoders, essential components in
            telecommunications and signal processing.
        </p>

        Another important property in Boolean algebra is the complemented lattice. A complemented
        lattice is one where every element has a complement in the lattice.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.is_complemented()
        </input>
        <output>
            # Returns True if the lattice is complemented, along with a certificate if applicable.
        </output>
