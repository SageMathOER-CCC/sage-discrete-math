        A  Boolean algebra is a bounded lattice that is both complemented and distributive.

            In digital electronics, the principles of Boolean algebra guide the design of circuits such as multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, and decoders, essential components in telecommunications and signal processing.

        The following Sage cell checks whether the divisor lattice is distributive. A distributive lattice is one where the operations of join and meet distribute over each other.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.is_distributive()
        </input>
    </sage>
    <p>
        Another important property in Boolean algebra is the complemented lattice. A complemented lattice is one where every element has a complement in the lattice.
    </p>
    <sage>
        <input>
            p = Posets.DivisorLattice(20)
            p.is_complemented()
        </input>

            Software engineers use Boolean algebra to simplify conditions, refactor code, and optimize logic. These skills are crucial for identifying bottlenecks and improving efficiency in real-time systems and performance-critical applications.
