  <title>Logic Gates</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This chapter explains how to process binary inputs in Sage to produce specific outputs based on basic logic gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT. Then, we show how these gates combine to form more complex circuits and integrate into everyday electronics, using built-in and customized Sage functions to simulate and analyze their behavior.
