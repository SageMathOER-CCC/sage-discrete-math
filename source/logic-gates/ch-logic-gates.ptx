  <title>Logic Gates</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of all digital systems, from simple calculators to complex computers. These gates process binary inputs (0s and 1s) and produce a specific output based on the type of gate used, like <c>AND</c>, <c>OR</c>, or <c>NOT</c>. Understanding how these gates work is key to grasping how digital circuits perform calculations, make decisions, and control operations. In this chapter, weâ€™ll explore how logic gates function, how they combine to form more complex circuits, and how they integrate part of our everyday electronics.
