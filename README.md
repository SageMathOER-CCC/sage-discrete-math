# Discrete Math with SageMath

## Chicago City Colleges Open Educational Resource

Welcome to our interactive online textbook for learning Discrete Mathematics with SageMath.

### Empowering mathematicians and computer scientists with open-source tools

We are developing essential resources for students to use mathematical software effectively. Our goal is to streamline the learning process with SageMath. This approach helps students focus more on mathematics and reduces the friction of learning how to code. Our resources are designed for all math students, regardless of programming experience.

### What is SageMath?

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is a free, open-source mathematics software system, based on Python. It integrates well-known open-source packages that include NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R, and many [others](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/). SageMath is fulfilling the need for a robust and free alternative to proprietary software like Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab.

### Why Discrete Mathematics with SageMath?

Our first textbook focuses on discrete mathematics. SageMath allows students to explore and visualize complex concepts, boosting their understanding and skills in this essential subject.
